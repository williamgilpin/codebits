# codebits

Various small pieces of code and utility scripts that separately don't merit individual repositories. If GitHub ever allows gists and repos to both be accessible and searchable from the same user profile, then I will convert these over to gists.


### Contents

`/python_stuff`

Helper functions that I use in python a lot

`/utility_scripts`

Useful functions for working with data and files on my computer

`/miscellany`

Stuff that I don't know how to categorize but that I still want under version control
